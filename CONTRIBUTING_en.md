# Contributing

[简体中文](./CONTRIBUTING.md) | English

Welcome to participate in development! To ensure code maintainability and playability, if you wish to develop new features or gameplay, please first contact me (by sending a [mail](mailto:zoujin.dev@exlb.org) or opening an [Issue](https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet/issues/new)) with your idea. This is to make sure your contribution fits the game, and will not get outright rejected for being unfitting (causing your effort to be wasted). You don't need to contact me regarding fixing errors or bugs - simply send a PR in that case.

After I approve your idea, you may [fork](https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet/fork) the code repository and make your changes, then submit them by opening a [pull request](https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet/compare). If it doesn't get approved, you can always make your own version of this game (that will be subject to [Apache License version 2.0](LICENSE) and the [animation copyright notice and authorization terms](#animation-copyright-notice-and-authorization-terms)).

Note that to make sure the features/gameplay you contribute fit the game, I may make changes to your code.

Also note that the addition of new features can usually be accomplished with plugins - see [VPet.Plugin.Demo](https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet.Plugin.Demo) for more information.

Thanks to the following participating developers (in order of contribution):

## How to deploy Vpet-Simulator.Windows

1. Download the source code, and open `VPet.sln` with Visual Studio.
2. Change the project to generate to `Vpet-Simulator.Windows`, and the configuration to `x64`.
   ![Demonstration of the above](README.assets/image-20230208004330895.png)
3. Click on `Run`. If everything is OK, you will get the following message: `Lack Mod Core, Unable start desktop pet`
4. Run `Vpet-Simulator.Windows/mklink.bat` as administrator. This links the `mod` folder to the build folder.
5. Click on `Run` again, and this time the app will run.
