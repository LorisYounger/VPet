![Header](README.assets/%E4%B8%BB%E5%9B%BE.png)

An open-source desktop pet/shimeji/virtual pet app, that can be embedded into any Windows Presentation Framework app as well.

Get VPet [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920960/VPet) for free, or install its core library to your WPF app with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VPet-Simulator.Core).

## Introduction

***VPet*** is a desktop pet app with various interactions implemented. It's open-source, free, and supports mods from the Steam Workshop. ~~Well, it's free, so why not try it out?~~

This game was originally developed for *[VUP-Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352140/_/)*'s tutorial as an accompanying desktop pet, then split into an independent app. If you like it, please consider adding VUP-Simulator to your wishlist.

### Many interactions and animations!

Up to 32<sub>(types)</sub> * 4<sub>(states)</sub> * 3<sub>(variants)</sub> = 384 animations included! (Note that some types don't have ill versions or loops etc., so the actual number is slightly smaller.)

#### Have some examples:

##### Head-patting

##### Lifting

##### Wall-climbing

See [image resources](#%E5%9B%BE%E5%83%8F%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90) for more information. <!-- FIXME: dead link and IDK what this corresponds to -->

### Free!

This game is **100% free**! ~~So if it looks good to you, try it out, it won't hurt.~~ <br/>
Our main goal is to promote [VUP-Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352140/_/) with it; the default character here is the main character there.

### Open source!

The source of this game is available on GitHub. You can find it at: https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet

Feature requests and pull requests are welcome! You can take our code and modify it to your liking, too. (Though most content doesn't require that, and can be modded in.)

### With Steam Workshop support!

Steam Workshop mods are supported. With mods, you can add your own pets (animations/interactions), and share them with others through the Workshop.

The following contents can be added or modified by Workshop mods:

* Pet animations
* Items, foods/drinks, etc.
* Work
* Dialogue
* Themes
* Plugins - adding extra content to pets with code. For example:
  * New animation logic/solutions (e.g. Live2D and Spine)
  * New features (e.g. alarm and notes)
  * Basically anything - see [VPet.Plugin.Demo](https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet.Plugin.Demo) for examples

## Contributing

Welcome to participate in development! To ensure code maintainability and playability, if you wish to develop new features or gameplay, please first contact me (by sending a [mail](mailto:zoujin.dev@exlb.org) or opening an [Issue](https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet/issues/new)) with your idea. This is to make sure your contribution fits the game, and will not get outright rejected for being unfitting (causing your effort to be wasted). You don't need to contact me regarding fixing errors or bugs - simply send a PR in that case.

After I approve your idea, you may [fork](https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet/fork) the code repository and make your changes, then submit them by opening a [pull request](https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet/compare). If it doesn't get approved, you can always make your own version of this game (that will be subject to [Apache License version 2.0](LICENSE) and the [animation copyright notice and authorization terms](#animation-copyright-notice-and-authorization-terms)).

Note that to make sure the features/gameplay you contribute fit the game, I may make changes to your code.

Also note that the addition of new features can usually be accomplished with plugins - see [VPet.Plugin.Demo](https://github.com/LorisYounger/VPet.Plugin.Demo) for more information.

## How to deploy Vpet-Simulator.Windows

1. Download the source code, and open `VPet.sln` with Visual Studio.
2. Change the project to generate to `Vpet-Simulator.Windows`, and the configuration to `x64`.
   ![Demonstration of the above](README.assets/image-20230208004330895.png)
3. Click on `Run`. If everything is OK, you will get the following message: `Lack Mod Core, Unable start desktop pet`
4. Run `Vpet-Simulator.Windows/mklink.bat` as administrator. This links the `mod` folder to the build folder.
5. Click on `Run` again, and this time the app will run.
